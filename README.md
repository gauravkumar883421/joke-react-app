# React + Vite

# Joke React App

A simple React app that fetches a random joke from the [Official Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/).

## How it works

- Uses `fetch()` to retrieve data from an external API
- Displays joke setup and punchline
- Shows loading and error states
- Optional: Refresh button to get new jokes
